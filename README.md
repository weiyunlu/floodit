#This is a Java implementation of the FloodIt game.

It has the following features:
- Specify size of the board on command line (default = 12).
- Change settings to allow diagonal moves and torus play (default = orthogonal and planar).
- Undo and redo.
- Autosave on exit; autoload on startup if size of board is compatible.
